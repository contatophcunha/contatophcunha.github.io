# Creating a Flask Application on Kubernetes: Displaying the Container Hostname

Microservices environments are becoming increasingly popular due to their scalability, resilience, and flexibility. Kubernetes is one of the most robust platforms for orchestrating these services. Today, we will learn how to create a simple Flask application that, when executed on a Kubernetes cluster, displays the message "HELLO WORLD" and the hostname of the container in which it is running.
This application can be used as a practical example to understand how to deploy and scale applications on Kubernetes.

## Objective

In this tutorial, we will create a simple web application using the Flask framework (in Python), package it in a Docker container, and then deploy it to Kubernetes. The application will display:

- The message "HELLO WORLD".
- The hostname of the container, which is the name of the pod in which the application is running within Kubernetes.

At the end, the application will be accessible through an external IP using Kubernetes' NodePort feature.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need:
- A Kubernetes cluster (we can simulate one using Multipass, Docker Desktop, Killecoda).
- Docker installed to build the application image.
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes, Docker, and YAML.

### Step 1: Create the Flask Application

First, let's create a simple Flask application that displays a message and the container's hostname.

Flask code (app.py)
```python

from flask import Flask
import socket

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    hostname = socket.gethostname()
    return f"HELLO WORLD! Hostname: {hostname}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=80)

```
In this code, Flask defines a route (/) that returns the message "HELLO WORLD!" followed by the name of the container (hostname) where the code is running. This is useful in environments with multiple containers, such as Kubernetes, where each pod receives a unique hostname.

### Step 2: Create the Dockerfile

Now that we have the Flask application, we need to package it into a Docker image so that it can run in any environment. We will create a Dockerfile for this.

Dockerfile (Dockerfile)
```dockerfile

# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application files to the container
COPY app.py .

# Install Flask
RUN pip install Flask

# Expose port 80 to the application
EXPOSE 80

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

```

**This Dockerfile does the following:**

1. Uses a Python 3.9 base image.
2. Sets the working directory to /app.
3. Copies the app.py file into the container.
4. Installs dependencies, including Flask.
5. Exposes port 80 to external traffic.
6. Defines the command that will run the Flask application.

### Step 3: Build and Publish the Docker Image

Now that we have the code and Dockerfile ready, it's time to build the Docker image and then publish it so that it can be used by Kubernetes.

**Build the Docker Image**

docker build -t <your-username>/flask-hello-world:latest .

**Publish to Docker Hub**

docker push <your-username>/flask-hello-world:latest

Replace <your-username> with your Docker Hub username.

### Step 4: Create a Deployment in Kubernetes

Now that we have our Docker image published, we can create the YAML file to define our Deployment and Service in Kubernetes

YAML file (flask-app.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask-app
        image: <seu-usuario>/flask-hello-world:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: flask-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30007

```


***Explaining YAML***
- Deployment: Creates 3 replicas of our Flask application. Each pod will be based on the Docker image we published.
- Service: Exposes the application to external access via NodePort. Traffic on port 30007 will be redirected to port 80 of the Flask containers.

### Step 5: Deploy the Application to Kubernetes

- Now, let's apply the YAML file to our Kubernetes cluster.

**Apply Deployment and Service**
- kubectl apply -f flask-app.yaml

**Check if the Pods Are Running**
- kubectl get pods

**You should see something like this:**

- NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
- flask-app-12345               1/1     Running   0          10s
- flask-app-67890               1/1     Running   0          10s
- flask-app-abcdef              1/1     Running   0          10s


### Step 6: Access the Service

Now that the pods are running, you can access the application in the browser or via curl, using the Kubernetes node IP and port 30007:

- curl http://<node-ip>:30007 

This will return something like:

##### HELLO WORLD! Hostname: flask-app-12345

Each time you access the URL, the hostname may change, as Kubernetes will load balance requests across replicas.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we created a simple Flask application that displays "HELLO WORLD" and the hostname of the container it is running in. We packaged the application into a Docker image, published the image, and deployed the service to a Kubernetes cluster. By exposing the service via NodePort, we can access the application externally and see how Kubernetes handles multiple replicas and load balancing.
This approach is the foundation for developing more complex microservices-based applications in Kubernetes environments. From here, you can explore more features such as inter-service communication, automatic scaling, and performance monitoring.
